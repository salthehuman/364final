\i0 In this project, users will employ the New York Times API to retrieve article headlines, then rank headlines on how interesting they find them to be. \
\
First, users will enter their names, which subsequently serve as their list\'92s name. Then they will choose whether they want to search articles by 
\i section 
\i0 or by 
\i keyword
\i0 . \
\
If they select 
\i section
\i0 , they will then click one of five links, each of which corresponds to a specific section (Arts, Sports, etc.) of the paper. After doing so, they will see five article headlines from the selected section. \
\
If they select 
\i keyword
\i0 , they will enter a keyword to search for in all of the newspaper. After doing so, they will see five article headlines that match their keyword.\
\
At this point, regardless of choice, users will be prompted to click the artist that appears most interesting to them. After doing so, they will be asked to rate the interestingness of this article from 1-3. The article - along with its ranking - will then be stored to a database. This article can be removed at a later time, or its score can be adjusted.\

\i At the time of this project plan, I have not gotten the API responses up and running yet. Obviously, this will be fixed by final submission.}
